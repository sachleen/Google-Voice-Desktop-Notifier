Google Voice Desktop Notifier
-----------------------------

This is a simple Chrome extension that polls Google Voice and shows a desktop notification when new messages arrive.

**Note:** This extension is not my original work, it is a modification of an existing extension, [Mini Voice](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kppjgagclcbdjhmjhijcbjnneejdkegm) (Chrome Store link). Mini Voice does the same thing, only with a badge notification next to the address bar.

Usage
-----

The extension runs in the background, there is no indication of it running except for when a new message arrives. I use it in addition to the [official Google Voice extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kcnhkahnjcbndmmehfkdnkjomaanaooo). GV Desktop Notifier alerts me of new messages, and I view them by clicking on the icon next to the address bar.
